## Overview

Our Firsty Team designed an integrated ROS2 python script that subscribes and publishes to a create3 robot in order to produce an ocupancy map. 


The map displays a 2D image with obstacles (black), free-space (white), and unknown (red). A grey dot (cross) is displayed to represent the current locaiton of the robot. Script is able to update in live-time and reset the map with a keystroke ('r').
